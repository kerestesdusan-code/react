            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                My passion for computers and information technology began in my childhood.
                Inspired by a friend working in IT, I decided to dive into this field and
                started learning about various technologies intensively. This journey has been
                both fascinating and fulfilling for me.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                One of the results of my learning is this <a rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/kerestesdusan-code" className="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700">GitHub</a> repository, which showcases my
                knowledge and skills. It features a single-page application (SPA) demonstrating
                my work with technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, TypeScript, Node.js,
                CouchDB, Tailwind CSS, and many other components essential for building modern web
                applications.

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Although I donâ€™t have professional experience yet, I am highly motivated to start
                my career in the IT industry. I see immense potential in this field and envision my
                long-term future here. I am committed to continuous learning, self-improvement,
                and delivering value through my skills.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 font-semibold">
                Thank you for taking the time to learn about me, and I hope my work on this project
                captures your interest.
